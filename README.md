## Description
- Sometimes you have too many thoughts to keep them all inside; you need to share them with the world!
- Oh no. There are too many sites to choose from.
- Don't get lost in all the hub-bub. Use this Tech Blog site to share your darkest and brightest thoughts on the tech world.
- While building this application, I learned a lot about handlebars, routes, writing code for posting, putting, and deleting in front end js.
